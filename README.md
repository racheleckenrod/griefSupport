Big thanks to Brad @ Travery Media for the starter code for this chat app, as well 
as his tutorial that got me started with websockets and socket.io.

first commit with branch grace


This begins the feature of handleing sessions, guests and users.



****
Just checked out this new branch but I forgot to save my changed in the last 
commit I hopped into. now, I am pretty sure that I want to commit here, go back 
into the other one save the changes I made as they were resolving conflicts 
to at least make the code run. 

The current situation was ineffective for smooth interaction of the two sites.


this is some excellent looking code beautiful css and only one report from the database.
starting another branch here to work on the users/database/auth/guest so anyone can send a form

Keeping the readme log updated here, as I have deleted the old branch master and have reset the branch main to be the default branch, then in trying to push it up in it's new form it was not possible, so I changed its name to master....
