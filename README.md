Big thanks to Brad @ Travery Media for the starter code for this chat app, as well 
as his tutorial that got me started with websockets and socket.io.

first commit with branch grace

just pushed the origin head into the file, goint to do a simple push and see 
if it update on github now, that it wasn't doing before

just created branch copyWorkingMaster to sort this mess out fully
forgot to checkout the branch I made after I got here
Now I am on HurryUp and picking apart what needs to be done

I may be going backwards by doing this but we will see


Oh a bitty branch called tiny mistake to keep the commit on the detached head intact

just needed to perform a pruning of origin to allow a pull

Finding I had a remote called griefSupport then setting this branch to connect to it
I may be making some real progress in replacing the missing pieces..
I think this griefSupport branch is the one that connects with heroku(?)I dont see the update on github and this is supposed to be the master branch
Now, I did see it updated with previous commit..

I am making a small update here as I get closer to getting going

New Branch called major here with the intended purpose of reconnecting the branch
called griefSupport
Just got to this branch from the other side..
New branch minor may be able to help get the heroku connection cleared up
this pull connected with guthub and was pulled from branch major through griefSupportg

Now I am on branch minor second commit here..

Just set new remote connection for branch minor to origin and pushed it up

This appears to be the branch that was separated or intertwined but unreachable to gitHub.
called mustBeMasterGriefSupport at the moment- may be the main repo branch too
