Big thanks to Brad @ Travery Media for the starter code for this chat app, as well 
as his tutorial that got me started with websockets and socket.io.

first commit with branch grace

just pushed the origin head into the file, goint to do a simple push and see 
if it update on github now, that it wasn't doing before

just created branch copyWorkingMaster to sort this mess out fully
forgot to checkout the branch I made after I got here
Now I am on HurryUp and picking apart what needs to be done
