Big thanks to Brad @ Travery Media for the starter code for this chat app, as well 
as his tutorial that got me started with websockets and socket.io.

first commit with branch grace

just pushed the origin head into the file, goint to do a simple push and see 
if it update on github now, that it wasn't doing before

just created branch copyWorkingMaster to sort this mess out fully
forgot to checkout the branch I made after I got here
Now I am on HurryUp and picking apart what needs to be done

I may be going backwards by doing this but we will see

Finding I had a remote called griefSupport then setting this branch to connect to it
I may be making some real progress in replacing the missing pieces..
I think this griefSupport branch is the one that connects with heroku(?)I dont see the update on github and this is supposed to be the master branch
Now, I did see it updated with previous commit..


this is some excellent looking code beautiful css and only one report from the database.
starting another branch here to work on the users/database/auth/guest so anyone can send a form

Keeping the readme log updated here, as I have deleted the old branch master and have reset the branch main to be the default branch, then in trying to push it up in it's new form it was not possible, so I changed its name to master....

back here on hurryUp, ready to make a commit and possible merge with sessions
