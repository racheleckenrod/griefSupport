Big thanks to Brad @ Travery Media for the starter code for this chat app, as well 
as his tutorial that got me started with websockets and socket.io.

first commit with branch grace

just pushed the origin head into the file, goint to do a simple push and see 
if it update on github now, that it wasn't doing before

just created branch copyWorkingMaster to sort this mess out fully
forgot to checkout the branch I made after I got here
Now I am on HurryUp and picking apart what needs to be done

I may be going backwards by doing this but we will see

Finding I had a remote called griefSupport then setting this branch to connect to it
I may be making some real progress in replacing the missing pieces..
I think this griefSupport branch is the one that connects with heroku(?)I dont see the update on github 
and this is supposed to be the master branch
Now, I did see it updated with previous commit..

I am making a small update here as I get closer to getting going

The current situation was ineffective for smooth interaction of the two sites.



this is some excellent looking code beautiful css and only one report from the database.
starting another branch here to work on the users/database/auth/guest so anyone can send a form
Remembered to create a new branch from some beautiful working code and check it out and get myself read for working on it tomorrow.

I think that I am supposed to do a git pull from the hurryUp branch so this code it current before I start working on a feature of it. a pull request went to github automatically that I approved so now I am going to do a pull request from hurryUP
- after I commit the changes i am makeing in these note

Main has been renamed and changed back again and set to be the default branch. I am going to see If i can have the expected behaviour happen that my pushing my good single reporting mongo code up to main will fix main.

so I did not push this code, but did a merge. now ill push to origin

I used a plain old copy the contents of the file and paste it into the other file to accomplish my goal of having just one report coming back from mongo before I tried to do anything else with the code, but this was not a satisfying concluson to this deep dive into git hub, as I still dont see clearly how to update my code.

Upon return from formSubmission with it's contents of server.js to replace this non-working version, I find that the space coming back from the server is no longer present and it looks good.

just adding a note here about the absence of the package-lock.json being the main reason for this commit. and subswquent push to hopefully just github.
