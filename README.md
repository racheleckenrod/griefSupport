Big thanks to Brad @ Travery Media for the starter code for this chat app, as well as his tutorial 
that got me started with websockets and socket.io.


this code now runs. with mongo db, not sure about the functioning of the form submitting


just finished a reattaching of the head I think.

Pretty sure this main branch automatically deploys to heroku

just pushed the origin head into the file, going to do a simple push and see if it update on github now, that it wasn't doing before

ok, now I used the mistake branch to get this branch connected to heroku/main that is different than origin/main. eventaully renaming one, if not both of these branches is in order.
