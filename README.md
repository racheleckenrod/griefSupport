Big thanks to Brad @ Travery Media for the starter code for this chat app, as well as his tutorial that got me started with websockets and socket.io.

first commit with branch grace

glad I thought of coming here to heroku-deploy/main as there was a detached HEAD here too.

now I am back at the detached HEAD after making a commit looks like I need to create another branch. I certainly didn't mean to deploy my main HeAD to heroku. it has been quite a lot of effort to get it back.

I made branch freedom to separate main from master. to say it again, the ddefault branch setting is more than jjust a name change,,,...

this freedom branch has two READMEs so gets two this is the .md
