Big thanks to Brad @ Travery Media for the starter code for this chat app, as well as his tutorial 
that got me started with websockets and socket.io.


this code now runs. with mongo db, not sure about the functioning of the form submitting


just finished a reattaching of the head I think.

Pretty sure this main branch automatically deploys to heroku

Making a comment here to start to sort out the codebase

Master is not deploying to heroku

a most recent push to main also deployed directly to heroku, but I suspect 
after the pull request is complete it wil not.Î©
