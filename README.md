Big thanks to Brad @ Travery Media for the starter code for this chat app, as well as his tutorial that got me started with websockets and socket.io.

Making a comment here to start to sort out the codebase

I am intending to use this code as the base going forward


Making a comment here to start to sort out the codebase

I am making a small update here as I get closer to getting going

Pretty sure this main branch automatically deploys to heroku

just pushed the origin head into the file, going to do a simple push and see if it update on github now, that it wasn't doing before

ok, now I used the mistake branch to get this branch connected to heroku/main that is different than origin/main. eventaully renaming one, if not both of these branches is in order.
