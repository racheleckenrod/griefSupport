Big thanks to Brad @ Travery Media for the starter code for this chat app, as well 
as his tutorial that got me started with websockets and socket.io.

first commit with branch grace

 freedom:


glad I thought of coming here to heroku-deploy/main as there was a detached HEAD here too.

now I am back at the detached HEAD after making a commit looks like I need to create another branch. I certainly didn't mean to deploy my main HeAD to heroku. it has been quite a lot of effort to get it back.

I made branch freedom to separate main from master. to say it again, the ddefault branch setting is more than jjust a name change,,,...

this freedom branch has two READMEs so gets two this is the .md
END OF FREEDOM
just pushed the origin head into the file, goint to do a simple push and see 
if it update on github now, that it wasn't doing before

just created branch copyWorkingMaster to sort this mess out fully
forgot to checkout the branch I made after I got here
Now I am on HurryUp and picking apart what needs to be done

I may be going backwards by doing this but we will see

Finding I had a remote called griefSupport then setting this branch to connect to it
I may be making some real progress in replacing the missing pieces..
I think this griefSupport branch is the one that connects with heroku(?)I dont see the update on github and this is supposed to be the master branch
Now, I did see it updated with previous commit..


this is some excellent looking code beautiful css and only one report from the database.
starting another branch here to work on the users/database/auth/guest so anyone can send a form
Remembered to create a new branch from some beautiful working code and check it out and get myself read for working on it tomorrow.

I think that I am supposed to do a git pull from the hurryUp branch so this code it current before I start working on a feature of it. a pull request went to github automatically that I approved so now I am going to do a pull request from hurryUP
- after I commit the changes i am makeing in these note

Main has been renamed and changed back again and set to be the default branch. I am going to see If i can have the expected behaviour happen that my pushing my good single reporting mongo code up to main will fix main.

so I did not push this code, but did a merge. now ill push to origin

***lots of housekeeping

getting back here to main from a trip to heroku to pick up detached HEADS . it was unintentional that that happened. one for master, and one for main,

Interesting to me that making last last commit w/ the message  'heading to heroku-deploy' separted it(heroku-deploy) from this, the main. The readme.txt file that i just made up in branch freedom is not here but the LICENSE.txt is- remeber that it  wasnt up there..
this branch is to deal with the authentication and revamp what I have done that didn't turn out to be a good way- replace feedback auth into guests and two routes for the way to deal with the clicks of the button. will most likly also git into the sessions to keep our users logged in. maybe limit the guests to one chat room


time to come back from experimenting and going off on tangents. and bring it all back together.. I dont yet know about the proper way to make commits. 

my journey though the what ever that was is alll done now, and I am settling in to develpo this app

xoxoxoxooxxoxox



made it back from heroku-deploy and it appears to be separate from main now

for some updates..

it seems that heroku will take your HEAD. so, for me, it is best to create a transfer branch that I dont mind giving the head to heroku. It is just very important to return to main when the deployment is complete, and I may be wrong so Ill commit this- now that the README txt file is removed. then confirm the update to my default main in github. this deployment created a new branch according to heroku 

remote: Verifying deploy... done.
To https://git.heroku.com/grief-support.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main

 


back and forth to heroku-deploy without adding or committing

I am finding a way to switch fully to main and release master

back to complete after attaching detached head to breaking point and coming back here and deleting breakingPoint
making another stash
going to make a stash here.


the good css this branch had is no longer here, and the whole app in green and untracked, will a get status update the css?
