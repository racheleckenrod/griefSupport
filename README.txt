For clarity, I created this readme.txt file on branch freedom

back aways in my code, i think i remember seeing a README file with the .txt format, and i think it is associated with the HTML5UP template, but i am not sure about that, there was also a license that was added at some point that is missing here. I didn't manually add the LICENSE file. I did do the README.md without knowing the difference or even what .md is.

it appears that blank line in the terminal just reappeared
